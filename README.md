# natived-puppysupply-order-service

This app uses spring boot and postgresql to create a rest service to call a puppy order. 

This app uses both H2 database for local properties file as the database and the postgresql for the dev database

It uses JPA for some of the repositories and the jdbctemplate for some of the others.

I also included an example of calling an oracle stored procedure if the need arises to see 
how that can be implemented.
